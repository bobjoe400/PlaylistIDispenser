The final goal of our app is to be able to take playlist from one music service then go to another service, ie. Spotify to Google Play or vise versa. The prototype elemets are a table that loads playlist data from an online website through jsons. It can then display the list of songs within the playlist. We also have a fake profile page that works off of some json data.
